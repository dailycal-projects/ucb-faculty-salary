<h2>Departmental disparities</h2>

<p>Last year, over 15 professors in the Economics department at UC Berkeley were paid more than $300,000. Not a single professor in the Ethnic Studies department made more than $200,000. The highest-paid professor in the Rhetoric department earned only $135,000.</p>

<p>Departmental disparities in faculty pay reflect a broader trend. Universities across the country pay professors of business, economics, law and engineering far more than professors of the humanities and social sciences. Still, the differences at UC Berkeley are striking.</p>

<p>Take, for example, <a href="{% url 'person_detail' 'sanjam-garg' %}">Sanjam Garg</a>, an assistant professor of computer science who was paid about $210,000 in his second year at UC Berkeley. Assistant professors are of lower rank than associate professors and "full" professors. But Garg made more last year than <a href="{% url 'person_detail' 'shari-huhndorf' %}">Shari Huhndorf</a>, the chair of the Ethnic Studies department, who was paid about $180,000.</p>

<p>Beginning in the 1980s, the university began to establish a set of <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/compensation/2016-17-academic-salary-scales.html">salary scales</a> for business, economics and engineering and law professors different from those for professors in other departments. Today, a faculty member at the "full" professor rank can expect to be paid at least $83,000, unless they teach business, economics or engineering, in which case the salary guideline is $101,900. The same professor who teaches law can expect at least $139,900.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, the campus budget committee "accepted the reality of disciplinary market forces and described salary equity in terms relativized to discipline," according to a <a href="http://vpf.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Equity%20Study%20Report%20final%201-26-15%20--revised.pdf">campus report</a>.</p>

<p>However, faculty are often paid above the salary scales published by the university. <a href="{% url 'person_detail' 'shachar-kariv' %}">Shachar Kariv</a>, the chair of the Economics department, was paid $507,000 last year, making him the highest-paid professor at UC Berkeley. Sixteen other professors were paid more than $400,000. All but two were in the economics, business or law departments.</p>

<p>According to the campus report, current salary practices are necessary for recruiting and keeping faculty. Without them, Berkeley would be "unable to recruit as successfully as it has; the campus would lose many valued colleagues to other universities; and other universities would step up their efforts to recruit faculty away from Berkeley," the report says.</p>

<p>Salaries at UC Berkeley lag those at private institutions, though the gap is smaller than at many other public schools. According to a <a href="https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/2015salarysurvey/2015tab4.pdf">report</a> from the American Association of University Professors, the average pay of UC Berkeley professors in 2014 was about $173,000, while the average across private universities was about $178,000. At Stanford University, the average pay was about $224,000, while the average for professors at public universities was about $130,000.</p>

<p>“The UC salary scales are not salary guidelines, rather they indicate the minimum salary that can be paid based on a professor’s rank and, loosely, amount of experience,” said Ben Hermalin, the campus vice provost for the faculty, in an email. “It has been long recognized by the Office of the President and others that the salary scales are seriously below market.”</p>
