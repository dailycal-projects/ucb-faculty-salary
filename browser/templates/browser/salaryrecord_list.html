			<h2>Departmental disparities</h2>
			<p>Last year, over 15 professors in the Economics department at UC Berkeley earned more than $300,000. Not a single professor in the Ethnic Studies department made more than $200,000; the highest paid professor in the Rhetoric department earned only $135,000.</p>

			<p>Departmental disparities in faculty compensation are no secret — they reflect a market that compensates professors of business, economics, law, public policy and engineering far more than professors of the humanities and social sciences. Still, the differences at UC Berkeley are striking.</p>

			<p>Take, for example, Sanjam Garg, an assistant professor of computer science who earned about $210,000 in his second year at UC Berkeley. He earned more than Shari Huhndorf, the chair of the Ethnic Studies department, a full professor who last year earned about $180,000.</p>

			<p>The university has established different salary scales for business, economics, engineering and law professors. An entry-level professor can expect to be paid at least $83,000, unless they teach business, economics or engineering, in which case the salary guideline is $101,900. The same professor who teaches law can expect at least $139,900.</p>

			<p>Moreover, salaries of UC Berkeley faculty are often above the salary scales published by the university. Shachar Kariv, the chair of the Economics department, earned $507,000 last year, making him the highest-paid professor at UC Berkeley. Sixteen other professors were paid more than $400,000. All but two were in the economics, business or law departments.</p>

			<p>However, salaries at UC Berkeley still lag those at private institutions by a significant margin. In 2014, the average salary for a professor at UC Berkeley was about $170,000, while the average at Stanford University was about $220,000, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>

			<p>“The UC salary scales are not salary guidelines, rather they indicate the minimum salary that can be paid based on a professor’s rank and, loosely, amount of experience,” said Ben Hermalin, the campus vice provost for the faculty, in an email. “It has been long recognized by the Office of the President and others that the salary scales are seriously below market.”</p>

			<h2>About this project</h2>

			<h3>The data</h3>
			<p>The university publishes employee pay data on <a href="https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/">its website</a> annually. But it doesn't have information on professors' and lecturers' departmental affiliations, and it's not easy to trace a person's salary over multiple years.</p>
			<p>We merged data from 2010 to 2015 from the university with 2005 to 2009 pay data from the UC Berkeley library. Then, we added information about departmental affiliations, where available. The result is the most complete public, downloadable database of pay information for UC Berkeley faculty.</p>

			<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
			<p>We're only analyzing professors, assistant professors, associate professors and lecturers. We've dropped information about administrators, adjunct professors, lecturers for the summer session and more. Also, we couldn't associate all faculty members with a department, and we've chosen to exclude those people from this website (they're still available in our <a href="https://github.com/dailycal-projects/ucb-faculty-salary/tree/master/data">processed data file</a>).</p>
			<p>Moreover, a professor's salary can vary year-to-year based on the portion of time they spend on campus; some salaries are based on the academic year, and some on the fiscal year. Making departmental comparisons is especially difficult because some departments may have more experienced professors who would consequently be paid more.</p>
			<p>Another technical note: in all cases, we're examining the faculty member's gross salary, the total amount they were paid by the university. Their base salary might be less.</p>

			<h3 id="download">Download and contribute</h3>
			<p>We're publishing the raw data and code used to create this database for journalists and researchers. Our pipeline can be used to analyze data from other campuses or for other positions within the university — for example, administrators or athletic personnel.</p>
